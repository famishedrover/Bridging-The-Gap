For the Montezuma's study data, the foil corresponding to the foil-label can be found in Figure 2 of main supplementary file. 

We also did a survey that allowed users to play the Sokoban variations, and provide concepts that they thought were relevant to particular actions of the game. The name and description of the concepts that were obtained in the survey are provided in the files:
Sokoban_env/concept_survey/Sokoban_cell_concepts.txt
Sokoban_env/concept_survey/Sokoban_switch_concepts.txt 

We have grouped together similar concepts in demarcated sections. There is also a section for concepts whose meaning was unclear.
